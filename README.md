# Attrition-Project
This project aims at getting insights from the attrition data of a company. Insights gained are intended to ascertain reasons for attrition ans potentially build processes to reduce attrition in order to boost efficient employee retention rate.
I cleaned the data using Microsoft Excel then i imported the file into Power BI where i did further cleanig, dropping of redundant column with Power Query. After this, i proceeded to make visualizations; line charts, bar graphs, pie charts of the data, Highlighting key performance indexes and including slicers
I then took the data into R to attempt building a model to predict attrition.
